            <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
            <p>
                Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used
                as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from
                the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal
                memory.

                This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the
                app may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to
                collect information and improve their services. You have the option
                to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is
                being sent to your device.

            <p>
                This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a
                third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these
                external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise
                you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no
                control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy
