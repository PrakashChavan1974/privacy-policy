			<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
			<p>
				Prakash Lotan Chavan built the Smart Education_FLN app as a Free
				app. This SERVICE is provided by Prakash Lotan Chavan at no cost
				and is intended for use as is.

			<p>
				This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with
				the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if
				anyone decided to use my Service.

			<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
			<p>
				Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly
				used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your
				browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your
				device's internal memory.
			</p>
			<p>
				This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
				the app may use third-party code and libraries that use
				“cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You
				have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and
				know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose
				to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions
				of this Service.

			<p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>

				I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the
				following reasons:

				<li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
				<li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties
				have access to their Personal Information. The reason is to
				perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they
				are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any
				other purpose.

			<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

				I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information,
				thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of
				protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over
				the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and
				reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
